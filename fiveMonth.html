                The most dangerous hurricanes are category 5. The Olympics logo has 5 rings. You have 5 seconds to pick up food when you drop it on the floor (supposedly).
                Our heart beats 5 pairs of syllables at a time. And now we has 5 whole months together ❤

                5 wholeass months of joy, pain, contentment and longing. It has been a rollercoaster every day for the past few months - with shifts between being extremely happy to be together and being so sad to be so far away from one another. That last hug on Friday the 13th of march - although being only 130 days ago - feels like a forever ago. It feels like an eternity since I last touched you, and that's been really hard. To wake up in the morning and just long to feel your touch every moment until I go to bed has been so difficult with the knowledge that it will be so long before I get to feel you again 😔. I can still remember exactly what a hug from you felt like: first the approach and the anticipation that I was about to touch you - it's in itself a feeling like no other to just know that I was about to feel you against me. Then there first contact and the tingles that came with it - that first touch always catches and makes me want to embrace you further. Then the deep embrace - feeling your body against mine as I pull you in closer and feel you so close to me and the realization sets in that between my arms I'm holding the girl I love - my everything - my whole world right there against my chest.

                Shali - I love you. I love you so so so so much. I love you more than I could possibly ever put into words 🥺❤ you have really made my life so much better than I ever knew it could be. You have genuinely made so happy these past 5 months. Even through lockdown, one of the most challenging things that ever could have happened, you have made me so amazingly happy and I'm so thankful for that. I don't know what I did to deserve someone who makes me as happy as you do and who puts as much effort into everything to do with this relationship as you. You have genuinely put so much effort into this - probably way more than I deserve 🥺 - and even when I was being annoying you stuck with me and have never once made me feel anything less than amazing. 

                Shali somehow in all the blandness of lockdown where everyday just blends together and it seems like nothing changes at all - you make every day special. You've made getting up in the morning not feel so laborious. You've made my days not feel so boring. And you've made my nights feel fun and exciting - especially our SPECIAL nights 😌. The only thing that could ever possibly make the days when I talk to you better - would be actually seeing you in person. 

                After so long without each other we finally got to be at least close to each other last month. It was a bitter sweet moment seeing you for the first time in so long. When I first walked up I notice you were standing there and I was suddenly worried about what the first thing I was going to say to you after so long was gonna be. Then you shouted at me for not wearing a jacket 😂❤ so you put that worry to rest. When you turned around to yell at me tho I realised something - you look so amazing in photos, like genuinely beautiful, but in person 🥵🥵🥵 jesus shali. 

                Shali I know that you always disagree and argue with me when I say it - but you are the most beautiful girl in the world. And I know you probably rolling your eyes right now 😂❤, but from the bottom of my heart it's true. You are just so amazingly gorgeous 🥺 I can't put into words just how stunning you are. Every single part of your body is absolutely perfect to me shali. Your hair is the best of any girl ever - rice water or not 😂. Your eyes - omg shali your eyes 🥺 it's so sad to see you chat nonsense about your eyes when I know for a fact that there is not a girl on this planet whose eyes are even half as beautiful as yours - and I mean it shali not just because we dating but because it's the truth - although since we are dating they are even more beautiful because those eyes belong to the girl I'm gonna make wifey one day ☺❤ and the girl I plan on spending the rest of my life with. Your smile - oh YOUR SMILE 🥺 - I could have been in three car crashes and lost every limb in one day but if I looked at that genuine smile I would be so happy and I would have no choice but to smile too. And the rest of your body oms 🤤🥵 if I mentioned everything then this message would be long even by my standard - so I'll just say: YOUR BOOBS ARE PERFECT YOUR ASS IS PERFECT YOUR PUSSY IS JUST OMS WOW. Ok now I've gotten that out 😂❤ - you is beautiful shali truly truly amazingly stunningly gorgeous. 

                Earlier this month we got our first real taste of what a real fight feels like - and honestly shali you showed a lot of maturity and I'm so happy I cab be in a relationship with someone like that ❤ and while the honeymoon phase is officially over - that just means that we have the rest of our relationship ahead of us - and I cant wait ☺❤

                I'm so glad that I have you shali ❤ so so so glad. You make me so much happier than I ever have been before. You make me want to be better for you and you always accept me and all my MANY faults 😂❤ and I thank you for that. Thank you for always being there for me, thank you for always being the one thing I can rely on to make me happy and most of all thank you for being my shali ❤ the most perfect girlfriend I could ever ask for.

                I love you so so so much shali ❤

                Happy 5 months dream girl 💛💛💛💛💛
