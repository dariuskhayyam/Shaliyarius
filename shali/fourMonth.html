            <par>Well well well. Yet another month goes by where I have somehow retained my realationship with the most amazing girl on the planet ❤. To say that the past four months have been challenging is an understatement - but to say that they haven't been rewarding is a complete non-truth. Because the truth is that the past four months that I've spent with you have, despite the trying circumstances, been the best four months of my life. I cannot imagine being without you anymore 🥺❤ you have become such an important part of my life and I cannot express just how much you mean to me.

                Shali I love you. I love you so so so much. I love you more than I could ever put into any amount of words. I love every aspect of you, physical and non-physical, and I thought that I would explain a few of the reasons why ❤
                
                To start off with, I thought I would talk about the amount of effort you have put into this relationship. Baby, from being the one to ask me to be your valentine, to helping me ask you out when I couldn't find the words, to make a move to hold my hand, to always being there to talk to, to working with me and my, numerous, relationship mistakes - baby you have always put so much into this ❤. We have had our fair share of obstacles in our way but you always face them and are willing to tackle them with me and keep this thing going no matter what happens. Bebe I hope you know how special you are for that - most people in relationships are not like that but you are ❤🥺 and that is all I could ever ask for.
                
                Next, I want to talk about how you are my rock and are always there when I need you ❤. Shali until I started dating you, I had nobody - except Billie and the inside of my cupboard - to help me through any of the emotional trials I under went. Even if you don't know it shali, sometimes I am going through some stuff when I talk to you and just hearing your voice or reading your messages makes it impossible to feel any way except ecstatic and blessed. The most vivid example of this is the time where I posted something kinda dumb on my status during this hectic sociopolitical climate we're in, and all of a sudden it seemed as if the whole world was after my throat. Except, that is, for my shali ❤🥺. Babe you sat and spoke to me for so long and you really made me feel so much better. Genuinely shali from the singing to the calling me out for lying about how I felt to just being there willing to help me - it meant so much to me, more than you could understand babe. I've never had anyone who was willing to do something like that and you didn't even expect anything in return ❤🥺. You are the perfect girlfriend my luv and that is just one of the reasons why.
                
                Another thing that makes you so perfect is your absolute beauty 🥺❤ inside an out. 
                
                Your inside beauty is proven by so many things that you have done in this relationship. You've never tried to change me despite all my - by most accounts - VERY annoying traits 😂❤, proving that you don't love some imagined version of me but you love me ❤🥺 just plain old me who never thought in a million years that I could be loved - to love me for me is all that I could ever EVER want in a relationship. You have - as I've mentioned always been there for me - proving just how committed you are to this relationship. You have - despite all your celebrity crushes - never compared me to or judged me against anyone else 🥺❤ that really shows just how loving you really are and it is really important in a relationship. You have built a trust in this relationship that I have never had with anyone else and you have never broken that trust in the entire four months that we have been together. It's that trust that makes us work so well - why we can share our bodies with each other, why we can do things without the other being jealous and why I was never *really* jealous of that Anrè bloke 😂❤. Baby you genuinely have the most beautiful personality that has allowed this relationship to flourish and I am so glad that I am luck enough to be dating someone like you ❤
                
                As for your outer, physical beauty - I've said it many times before and you didn't believe me but that won't stop me from saying it again - you are honestly the most beautiful person I have ever laid my eyes on. I remember walking into Afrikaans for the first time last year and seeing you standing there and just thinking to myself "oh my word shaliya is actually really pretty". One day stands out from last year - it was one of the fridays where we got to where our springbok shirts and jeans - and I remember on that day you looked so pretty, you were wearing these tight fitting clothes and it was highlighting things and oms you made me go to every lesson with you looking like that 😫 I had such a headache by the end of that day because there was so little blood going to my brain - if you can get me. Another instance, this year - and please don't think I'm creepy for this - but at the interhouse swimming you had a race and you really did have to take your clothes off right in front of me neh 😂❤ it's safe to say I had to cross my legs for majority of the day. Honestly shali every physical characteristic you have is just so incredibly beautiful ❤🥺 from top to bottom:
                Your hair - shali you genuinely have the prettiest hair of any girl I've ever seen. No matter how it's done or if it's even done at all you still manage to rock it.
                Your eyes 😍🥺 - shali when I look into your eyes I see everything in you, I see my future and my personified happiness and most importantly I see the essence of the girl I love more than anything else in this world. 
                Your smile - shali there are no words that could possibly describe just how beautiful that smile of yours really is 🥺 the world right now is so trash with everything going on but whenever you smile everything stops being trash. Everything is perfect. Everything is right. Because when you smile - and it's a genuine smile - it means that you are happy and when you are happy then I am the most happy man in the world. 
                Ok just a warning it gets fairly explicit here down 😂❤.
                Your breasts - Oh. My. Soul. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. There is nothing on this world or any other that could compare to the 2 boobs sitting on your chest. They are the PERFECT size. They are the PERFECT shape. The way the nipple sits so perfectly on top it 🤤 bae there aren't words that can express just how perfect they are. And when you play with them oh shit 🤤😫 but anyways that's slightly off topic.
                Your *ahem* primary sexual organ 😂❤ ok let's be real, your pussy - it is so perfect, SO perfect. Gosh the way the lips sit on you and perk out. The way it sounds when you're wet 🤤 damn. Its really truly so perfect. 
                Your ass - I really don't need to say anything here 😂❤ you know how fantastic it is. I know how fantastic it is. Everyone with eyes knows how fantastic it is. Yeah there's really nothing that needs saying.
                Your legs - godamn, enough said. They are amazing. Damn.
                Ok now that I've got all my horniness out and into the message we can come back into the romantic realm. You truly is the most beautiful woman in my world. There is no actress, model or general civilian that could ever be as pretty as my girl ❤.
                
                Another thing that I really love about you - is the energy you bring to my life. The Disney songs and and dancing around and everything shali you honestly made the most mundane of lessons exciting last year 😂❤. It really does always cheer me up to see you so energetic and it gives me such a sense of pride now to think "wow, that girl who's vibe is making everyone feel better - that's my girl 🥺❤". 
                
                One of things I miss most during this lockdown, if not the thing that I miss THE most - is your hugs. That moment when I look at you and know that I am about to hug you is always so exciting. Then we get closer and I put my arms under yours and pull you in. Gosh and I feel your body against mine and I love that feeling so much that I have to keep pulling you in closer to feel it more 🥺❤ and I hold you tighter and I feel your heartbeat and your chest moving with each breath and I just need to hold you tighter, to feel you even closer. Every time I never want to let you go 🥺 and I promise that one day we will get that feeling back. 
                
                Speaking of that elusive "one day", let's talk about the future - specifically how excited I am to spend the rest of mine with you. I am so happy that instead of looking forward at a future by myself like I was for all my life - I can look forward to spending it with the most amazing partner there could ever be. I can't wait for all the firsts that await us in our life 🥺❤ and there after all the seconds and thirds. Honestly a future with you is the only future I'm interested in - and don't worry I'm not gonna make any stupid decisions to get there 😂❤ because I know us, and I know that our future will survive through any hardships and thus the need to choose between you and anything else is completely redundant. I can't wait to spend my forever with the girl I love more than anything in this universe.
                My everything. 
                My whole world.
                My one.
                My true luv.
                My darling.
                My angel. 
                My gorgeous.
                My amazing.
                My shali ❤ 
                
                I love you Shaliya Ramparsad ❤
                
                Happy 4 months dream girl 💛💛💛💛</par>
