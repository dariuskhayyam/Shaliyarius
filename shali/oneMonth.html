            <par>
                "Will you be my valentine you can say no I'll just give the chocolate to someone else" - when I heard those words that will forever be immortalized in my memory I was in complete disbelief l. My whole life I'd never managed to conjure up the courage to ask anyone out but here before me stood this amazing beautiful girl with a 5 star chocolate bar in her hand asking ME to be her valentine. I liked you from the beginning of last year and I just felt like if I said anything other than a resounding yes - I would regret it for the rest of my life.
                The next day it was valentines ball I arrived - looking mediocre at best - and started talking with the boys and told Luke that someone had actually asked me to be their valentine - he was in absolute shock. Then I turned around - and I saw you and i my heart stopped. You looked absolutely stunning and I couldn't believe that this absolutely stunning girl was making her way down a steep embankment - in high heels - to see me. As I was finishing my shift at the tuck shop gabriel told me that I needed to make sure I spent tonnes of time with you - and I intended to. That was an amazing night shali - especially the slow dancing - and was truly something I will always remember.
                Honestly shali you know all these stories- you were there - but what you can never fully understand is just how much you mean to me and how much I appreciate you and really like you and I wish I could say more but I've run out if time. Sorry.
