                So, another anniversary - and unfortunately - it's another one spent apart. We haven't seen each other in sixty-nine days - which arouses mixed emotions cause like on the one hand, NICE üòÇ‚ù§ but on the other hand it's not nice at all üòî its been the hardest sixty-nine days of my life. Waking up every morning and knowing that I wont get to hug you has been really heart breaking. But the one thing that's getting me through this - is my dream girl. I don't know what I would do without you shali - everytime I'm feeling down about anything and I hear your message tone I immediately start smiling because I just cant help being happy while I'm talking to you. I know that this is by no means an ideal situation and I wish I could have seen you and hugged you and kissed you today ü•∫ but I promise I'll make up for all the missing hugs and kisses when we are together again. For now though I can just tell you that I love you and that april the 13th at about 2:00am was one of the best moments of my life ‚ù§.

                Now shali I know that one of your favorite things in the whole world is Disney, and I just wanted to tell you how you really have made me feel like I'm in a disney movie ‚ù§ and how I thought best to do that was to take you through some of the best Disney quotes - and show you how you make them real. 

                "Happiness is the richest thing we will ever own" ~ Donald Duck. Shali before we started dating, I was really not in a good place - I was just wondering around life, not really caring about anything or anyone and not thinking that anyone would ever care about me either. I genuinely never thought that someone would say 'I love you' to me - not in a million years. But you did ü•∫‚ù§ and that meant more to me than I could ever put into words. I am happier now that I have you than I ever have been in my entire life. I could never fully express just how happy you make me feel and my most important goal is to try and make you just as happy - because all I want is for you to be as happy as you deserve, and you deserve to be VERY happy.

                "All at once everything looks different now that I see you" ~ Rapunzel. Every morning I wake up with a smile. Every day I think about you and everything is ok. Every night when we call - even for just a little while - it is the best part of my day. The truth is that everything I look at, I see you in. Every travel destination I hear about I think about what it would be like to go there with you. Every house design I see I think about what it would be like to live there with you. Every time I cook I try make sure that it's something that I could cook for you one day ‚ù§ - and by the way now that I haven't eaten them for a while I realise your right eggs are not appealing at all üòÇ‚ù§. But the point is that I can't go even a few minutes without thinking about you - about how much I love you, about how much I want to be with you and about how much better life is when you are a part of it. 

                "Because when I look at you, I can feel it. And I look at you and I'm home" ~ Dory. Shali when I look at you I see many things - I see the most beautiful girl in the world - whose smile is infectious on even the worst of days, whose laughter can uplift anyone no matter what they're going through. When I look at you I see the girl I want to spend the rest of forever with. When I see you I see the first person I ever felt I could genuinely say "I love you" to. No matter what's going on, no matter how tired or stressed or worried I am when I see you, or hear your voice or read a message all the negative emotions melt away and I'm left with only the movie-like love I have for you ‚ù§ when I look at you I see the girl I love more than anything else in the world.

                "My dream wouldn't be complete without you in it" ~ Tiana. This one hits especially true shali - every time I think about life after school, or even next year or even tommorow I can't help but imagine you as a part of it. Every one of my dreams about the future has you as a part of that future - I honestly can't imagine life without you anymore ‚ù§ I genuinely have no idea how I went so long without my shali. And even though I don't have very many dreams when I sleep, pretty much the only good ones that I can remember are the ones that involve you (you know the ones üòÇ‚ù§). And I suppose this does make sense - you are my dream girl after all ‚ù§

                "I'd rather die tommorow than live a hundred years without knowing you" ~ John Smith. Shali there is nothing in the world that I would ever trade what we have for. No amount of money, no magic, no nothing that could ever be equal to you. I would rather sit in physics with Trenor for six hours a day, every day, for the rest of my life than not have you ‚ù§. You is my number one, this relationship is the thing I value most of all in my life and nothing could ever convince me otherwise. I would choose you over anything shali - absolutely anything. 

                "Every minute spent in your company becomes the new best moment of my life" ~Bolt. It's hard, nay impossible to pick my favorite moment we've had together. From that fateful morning when you said "Will you be Valentine you can say no I'll just give the chocolate to someone else", to when I, after a lot of delaying and stalling, asked you out, to holding your hand for the first time, to holding your hand for the second time, to holding your hand for the third time, to holding you while watching that movie ,to gallivanting around the school in the rain with you after I asked you out, to that hug on the staircase, to that last hug we had, to any and all of the morning hugs, to our first video call, to the first time we said "I love you" to each other - there are just far to many amazing moments to pick a favorite. Even on a day that would be otherwise uneventful - you have away of making it into one of the most special days ever. Here's to many more amazing moments my luv ‚ù§

                "If you focus on what you left behind, you will never be able to see what lies ahead." ~ Gusteau. Shali, I know it's been really hard these past couple months, not being able to hug or kiss or go on our first date. We really haven't had the typical first three months that most relationships have - and I know that that doesn't seem fair at all. But I believe that what we lost in physically seeing each other - we've gained in knowing each other. When we were at school, things were really busy and both of us had a lot of commitments, we would only really get to talk to each other for maybe a couple hours a day, but because of this whole situation there have been days where we've spent six hours just talking to each other and getting to know each other - we're a three month couple that knows each other better than a lot of six month couples do. So even though I know that its tempting to look at it as of we've missed out on so much, just think about how much closer we are now than we were before this - and just think about how much better things will be when we see each other again. Don't get me wrong though I think we've reaped all the neccessary benefits and it's about time that we saw each other again üòÇ‚ù§, but I'm just saying that overall, this may end up being a really positive experience for our relationship, after all - remember, if we can endure this we can endure anything. ‚ù§

                Truer words have never been spoken than when I tell you that I love you shali ‚ù§ I mean it with every fiber of my being and with every ounce of my soul I LOVE YOU. The past three months have honestly been the best of my life and it's all thanks to you. I always assumed that the type of love from fairy tales and disney movies didn't exist, that there was no such thing as "true love" - but you really have proved me wrong, and you did it in the best possible way. I could never say enough thank yous for all the things you do for me shali ü•∫‚ù§ but from the bottom of my heart I want to say it - thank you my luv, thank you for always putting so much effort into this relationship, thank you for putting up with me so much, thank you for being the one thing in my life I can always rely on, thank you for loving me even when I'm unlovable, thank you for all the amazing hugs, and thank you for being my happily ever after ‚ù§. I think Jack Skellington from The Nightmare Before Christmas said it best when he said: "For it is plain as anyone can see. We're simply meant to be."

                I love you shaliya ‚ù§
