            <h3>Two Month Message: </h3>
            <par>
                "Will you go out with me?" - it's now been two months since I said those words. It was a bit after 2:30 on a friday and it was raining really heavily and I was SO nervous to ask you. Even though I was pretty sure that you would say yes - mostly because of the "you still need to ask the question" comment in mrs stirrat's class the day before üòÇ - I was still super nervous. I was nervous that you might say no and - perhaps more so - I was nervous about what would happen if you said yes.

You put the first worry to rest immediately when you said yes - but the second worry persisted in my mind. I had never been in a relationship before - as you know - and I'd never even thought about actually asking someone out before. I didn't know what to expect at all. But then, after our escapades through the rain and when you were all set to go, we hugged. It was the first hug of our official relationship relationship and I knew right then that I had found my perfect girl - and all the worry about how the relationship was gonna go was immediately cast out of my mind because I knew that as long as I was with you - everything would be ok ‚ù§

Since then that epiphany has proven to be absolutely correct. We didn't have the normal first few months of our relationship that most people get. We had only been together 3 weeks when school closed and we were forced into a surprise long distance relationship. There are a lot of couples who wouldnt have managed to keep it going like we have - everyone knows that distance relationships are not easy - but we do it - and we do it well, because we can do anything shali - we that good my luv ‚ù§

But let's rewind back to when things were all normal. If I could relive any 3 weeks of my life - I would relive those first 3 weeks with you. They were by a long long way the best weeks of my entire life. 

The first week was better than I ever expected it to be - like we were the best right from the beginning. We started of the week by writing a life science class test - usually a pretty solemn occasion - but I wasn't even that stressed out for it. In fact I studied not because I felt like I had to - but because I actually wanted to because I wanted to do well to keep our competition from last year going. I would wake up every morning - at like 2:00am no less - with a big smile on my face. I got out on the road and running didn't feel as hard - I wanted to do it because I wanted to be the best I could be for you ‚ù§. Then it was midterm - our first real taste of being apart for more than a weekend - and even after only a week it was pretty difficult. But we got through and got back to school which bring us to...

WEEK 2! This was of course a very very good week because of, you guessed it, camp! I was supposed to give you a really big hug the first time I saw you but I didnt get to - I'm really really sorry about that and I PROMISE that that will never ever happen again ‚ù§. But then we arrived at camp - this was our first time really spending time with each other outside of school and - besides you not getting any food (which was totally wack btw) - it was AMAZING. On that first night we were sitting together on a table and we were talking to people - and then we saw moeketsi and phume (RIP) holding hands and we both simultaneously said "aaaawwww" - and I was pretty conflicted cause like - I wanted to hold your hand, but I didn't know if you wanted me to. And then you said "put your hand like this" and I did it with the wrong hand and after you corrected me you grabbed my hand and OH MY SOUL - I legit thought I was gonna faint. It felt like a dream - I was holding my shali's hand - I couldn't believe it. I felt dizzy - but in a good way. It was a feeling I can't explain - it was like everything was perfect - because it was ‚ù§. The next night was equally as, if not more, amazing. We all sat in the hall to watch the movie and at first I sat in the normal place next to the boys - but then I noticed that you were sitting pretty close by and there was space next to you. I was actually pretty nervous nervous to move closer to you cause like - sitting with a pretty girl, especially one as pretty as you (cause you the prettiest but we getting there ‚ù§) is always pretty nerve racking. But deep down I new that as long as I was with you I would be ok. And so I butt scooted over to you - and then Byron tried to sit next to you and Gabriel had to shout at him üòÇ - I owe gabriel one for that. You know what's really funny is that at the start of the movie Jacob told us specifically not to lie on people - but that didn't last very long so it ok. And so there we sat and you laid your head on me and I was like - do I put my hand on her shoulder? Do I not? - I was pretty confused I'd never been in this situation before üòÇ‚ù§. But since it was you - there was no need to second guess myself, and so I put my arm around you and there we sat - holding each other for like two hours. It wasn't a bump free ride - the leg cramps and comments from Danilo and Maja were all things that had to be dealt with ‚ù§üòÇ. But I was holding my girl, you, so everything was perfect. Then on the third night we sat together and you put your leg on me and we were just chatting and honestly I couldn't believe how lucky I was to be with someone as amazing as you - and it was during our chat that I started to realise just how deeply I was falling for you. Then we started walking back to the rooms and we started holding hands and I got that amazing feeling again. Then once we got there I hugged you to say goodnight and mrs pretorius jumped me üòÇ. I was lowkey pretty scared but it all turned out ok - and it made a hell of a good story. The next morning when we left we had a big hug and that was the perfect way to end the perfect week with the perfect girl ‚ù§.

Week 3 we were back at school and by this point our relationship was in full swing. We were hugging every morning and having our little arguements at break. On the monday we sat and talked in mrs stirrats class after school but then I had to go to robotics. You walked up the stairs with me and on the landing of the third flight of stairs we had - the hug - the hug to end all hugs! It was amazing - I held you so close and I just never wanted to let you go - I wanted to stay on those stairs and hug you forever ‚ù§. The week went on and there were a fair share of hardships - you got your life science mark back and were pretty disappointed with it - so I sat with you on the floor and and tried to make you feel better. But overall it was another week with my shali - and thus another of the greatest weeks of my life. Then on friday we had to write a physics test so we were both in a hurry and then Sheldon started talking to me and - we didnt get to hug that morning üòî. At first I was pretty sad about it - but I had no idea what was coming that afternoon. After school you were teaching your friend those dances - and just btw can I just say that you are like an AMAZING dancer - like wow, just WOW, but anyways - I stood there with you and held your phone and watched your amazing dancing (again, WOW) and after that was done we started walking and you did your whole "put your hand like this" bit again ‚ù§üòÇ - and even though we only got to hold hands for a few seconds it was still amazing and it felt like magic ‚ù§. Then, in the hallway just next to the office - we hugged. OH. MY. GOD. That hug was quite possibly the best few minutes of my life. I held you so close to me - and I could feel you breathing and my breathing just synced with yours and it was just so so so perfect. After we stopped hugging I looked at you and every fiber of my being was telling me to kiss you. But I didn't - and I wish I did so much. But guaranteed that is NOT a mistake I'm going to make EVER again ‚ù§.

On sunday the fifteenth of march we found out that school was closing - and that I wouldn't get to hug you for a while. I was absolutely devastated that I wouldn't get to see you or hug you - and it made me really regret not kissing you when I had the chance. But, I pulled myself together and reminded myself that you are my shali, my whole world, the girl I would do absolutely anything for - and I was fully prepared to do everything and anything I could to keep our relationship strong for as long as we were apart. And that's what we did - through everything, through the news of lockdown starting, through lockdown being extended, through the stress of online school starting and through the anxiety of not knowing when we would see each other again. We got through it all and we will get through everything else that comes our way shali - we gonna go really far I know it ‚ù§.

Shali, I have given you quite a few compliments over our 2 months together - but I just wanted you to know that I mean every single one of them, with all my heart. You are my perfect girl shali - in every way. No one could EVER come close to you. I've said this before, but I don't often give all my reasons because it would take a long time - but I've got a few hours so let's go over a few - I can't go over them all because this message would take up all the storage on your phone.

Reason #1: you don't judge people until you know them. I have first hand experience with this. I'm admittedly not the most attractive personality upon first inspection, but when you get to know me - I'm a lot worse üòÇ - but that's not the point. The point is that you don't just have one conversation with someone and say "He's a jerk" or "She's a bitch" - you take your time to get get to know people and don't just make assumptions like it's so easy for a lot of other people to do.

Reason #2: you give your 100% to everyone, even if they don't deserve it. Shali you are such a caring and compassionate person that even if someone puts in 0% with you, you'll give them all the effort they want - that's not something everyone can do. And don't get me wrong - it's not always a good thing to put in effort with people who don't do the same - and it's something I never ever want you to have to do in this relationship - but the fact that you do just shows how far your willing to go for the people you care about. 

Reason #3: You make people feel better about themselves than they ever thought they could. Shali you will compliment people even when no one else will, and you honestly make everyone you meet happier than you can know, and none more so than me. The amount of times you've said something that has just made my heart feel so much better than it ever has before is a number to big to write. Everytime you say that I'm the best boyfriend or call me good looking (which is objectively untrue üòÇ‚ù§) it makes me happy beyond words - and I just want to say thank you so so so much for always making me feel so amazing and happy ‚ù§.

Reason #4: You are the most beautiful girl in the world. STOP! Stop thinking of a reply that involves you saying that you're not. YOU ARE. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT. You are the single most gorgeous person I have ever seen. There is no one else that I've met or that I've seen on TV, on magazine covers or in any other form of media - including my imagination - that is as pretty as you. You are the type of person people complain about being "unrealistically beautiful". If I could only see one thing ever again I would choose you, in fact it wouldn't even be a choice there is nothing else that could come close to being as beautiful as you. I know that you're probably rolling your eyes and not believing me - but I mean every word shali. You are absolutely stunning. Everything about you is the most beautiful thing ever. Your hair - which looks perfect no matter if you've just woken up or if you've worked on it, whether you say it makes you look like a lion or a cobra - it looks perfect. Your eyes - "oooohhh they're to dark" <- NONSENSE, COMPLETE NONSENSE - your eyes sparkle more than all the sequins in the world ever could - they shine like all the stars in the sky put together, and when I look into them - I see the person that I want to spent the rest of my life with ü•∫‚ù§. Your eyebrows - HOW DO YOU GET THEM SO PERFECT? LIKE REALLY? HOW??? Your smile - oh my soul shali your smile, it's as if God himself said "let me create the perfect smile" and then he gave it to you. If we ever live together load shedding is not gonna be a problem cause your smile can light up the whole city. And there is so much more beautiful about you; your lips - the most kissable lips on the planet, your legs - no comment needed, and yeah, not gonna lie, your ass is pretty fantastic. And yet, somehow, despite all of this - your looks are not the most beautiful thing about you ‚ù§. That's just how amazing you are. 

I know that in the grand scheme of things - two months doesn't seem like a lot - but anniversaries, in my opinion, are not celebrations of the past - but celebrations of the future - and if I have anything to say about it, that is going to be a very long time. I'm not just happy to celebrate two months with the best girlfriend on the planet - I'm so excited for everything that the future holds in store for us - I can't wait to celebrate our 3 month, our 4 month, 6 months, 1 year, 10 years, 50 years and many more. I look forward to talking to you again, to hugging you again, to holding your hand, to going on dates, to kissing you, to going through the good and the bad times with you, and to caring for and about you for our entire lives - which I promise I will ‚ù§.

On the thirteenth of april, at around two in the morning - you were on the phone crying and I was doing my best to console you, but the truth is that I was feeling the same way. We sat there on the phone and I knew, in my heart of hearts, that I would not leave until my girl felt ok. When the tears cleared and the smoke settled - you said something to me and said that I didn't have to say it back - but the truth is that I had wanted to say it for a long time - so I did say it back. I never thought that I would say it to anyone and mean it as much as I did shali - because words and pictures and anything else could never convey just how much I meant it. We haven't said it since - and the reason is not because I don't mean it anymore - but because whenever I think about saying it I start crying - but this is a message, so even though I am crying right now - you wont be able to tell. You don't have to say it back, I never want you to feel like you have to say it back - but I've said before that if I think something I say it - and rest assured, I don't think this, I know it. 

I love you Shaliya Ramparsad ‚ù§

Happy two months dream girl üíõüíõ
